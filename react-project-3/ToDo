Part 1 - Implement the front end UI:
    ☐ Build from a mobile first approach
        ☐ Design should be responsive
    ☐ Focus on the non-logged functionality
    ☐ Add Logged in functionality as a secondary feature
    ☐ Most important is the ability to click on a link, go to a new page and then back again
    ☐ With that core in place then add the CMS elements.


    Known Bugs:
        ☐ If you middle click or try to open a news item in a new tab, you can an error @started(18-07-25 11:58)
    
    General Notes / Objectives:
        ✔ Get routes up and running once basic structure is in place. @done(18-07-24 17:47)
        ☐ Mobile Menu should be controlled by swipe gesture or button located at bottom of page
            ☐ This is a good idea but I'm not sure where to even start with this.
            ☐ Could just use a basic menu for this project and integrate gestures in the next
        ☐ Media Queries
            ☐ 360px
                ☐ Extreme case scenario but good practice anyway
            ☐ 768px
                ☐ Mobile Nav Cutoff
                ☐ Probably the most adjustments at this point
                ☐ Limit width to 90%, create a margin at the sides
                ☐ Change header to have nav left and brand right
            ☐ 1200px
            ☐ 1500px
            ☐ 1920px
        
        ☐ If you click on a News Item at Home you should get a unique shareable URL
            ✔ Right now you get a path simply ends with /news-item @done(18-07-25 17:09)
            //☐ I think this is possible but I will need to go more in deapth with Routes
               // ☐ I solved a part of this by adding arraymap.id to the path
                // ☐ However the link is still not shareable at this point
                // ☐ I think this now has something to do with the onClick event because the data is loaded from an external file on click. If there's no click then there is not data loaded to state which returns an error.

            // Actually split it up into 3 seperate components.
            // A component for unique news item
            // A component to loop each news item
            // A component to display the end result
            // Code is a wee bit more manageable

Part 2 Implement Database functionality:
    ☐ Focus on getting a simple form to submit to the database with basic info
    ☐ No need to rush this, take your time and work through each challenge one by one.
    ☐ This is possible but you might need to go off and some tuturials / research to
